**Background**

Gizilo is an app that provides a simple, intuitive nutrition grading system using Machine Learning technology. Unhealthy diets are a major contributor to the rise of non-communicable diseases, but existing front-of-package nutrition labeling systems are often complex and ineffective in influencing consumer behavior.

Gizilo aims to empower people to make healthier food choices by delivering an easy-to-understand nutrition grading system. The app features a database of common food items, along with their nutritional information and a corresponding grade or score. Using AR technology, Gizilo can overlay this grading system directly onto products in real-time, allowing users to quickly assess the nutritional quality of their purchases.

Based on extensive research and stakeholder input, the Gizilo team has identified key nutritional factors to consider in the grading system and developed an intuitive way to combine them. The goal is to influence consumer purchasing behavior towards more nutritious options and ultimately reduce the burden of diet-related non-communicable diseases. The findings from this project could also inform policy decisions and drive reformulation efforts by the food industry.
